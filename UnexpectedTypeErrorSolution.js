The solution involves carefully validating the data type received from the API response and ensuring it matches the expected type for the library function.  Implementing robust type checks, such as using typeof or instanceOf to validate types, before passing data to the function should resolve the issue. If you're using TypeScript, leverage type annotations to catch these errors during development.  Ensure that the API response is in the correct JSON format, checking the structure and handling potential errors in the API response.
